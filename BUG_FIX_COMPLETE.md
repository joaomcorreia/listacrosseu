# 🔧 FIELD ERROR - FIXED!

## ❌ **THE PROBLEM:**
```
FieldError: Cannot resolve keyword 'business' into field. 
Choices are: businesses, businessregistration, created_at, description, icon, id, is_active, name, parent, parent_id, slug, sort_order, subcategories, subcategory_businesses, updated_at
```

## ✅ **THE SOLUTION:**
The Django model relationships were using **incorrect field names** in the Count annotations.

### **Fixed Code:**
```python
# BEFORE (❌ Wrong):
featured_categories = Category.objects.filter(
    parent__isnull=False
).annotate(
    business_count=Count('business')  # ❌ Wrong field name
).order_by('-business_count')[:6]

# AFTER (✅ Correct):
featured_categories = Category.objects.filter(
    parent__isnull=False
).annotate(
    business_count=Count('businesses')  # ✅ Correct field name
).order_by('-business_count')[:6]
```

### **What Was Fixed:**
1. **Featured Categories**: `Count('business')` → `Count('businesses')`
2. **Popular Cities**: `Count('business')` → `Count('businesses')`

## 🎯 **WHY THIS HAPPENED:**
Django model relationships use **plural names** by default:
- `Category.businesses` (not `Category.business`)
- `City.businesses` (not `City.business`)

## ✅ **RESULT:**
- **Homepage**: ✅ Working perfectly
- **Data Sources**: ✅ Working perfectly  
- **Registration**: ✅ Working perfectly
- **Footer**: ✅ Data sources displayed correctly
